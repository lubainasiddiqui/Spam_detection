# Spam_detection
A small NLP project for prediction of Spam Emails.

A novel algorithm proposed in this research solves this problem by using NLP based processing to classify relevant text attributes for email class and make template decisions by utilizing most relevant features and discarding overhead attributes. We used three classification Algorithm that are Na√Øve Bayes, KNN and Random Forrest Classifier. 
All three classifier give accuracy over 90% on both test and training set. Most challenging assignment in an accurate classification system is identifying the most precise way extract attributes from an email i.e., identifying minimum attributes that are sufficient to describe an email context and requirements.
